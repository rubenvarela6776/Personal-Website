        <p>my full name is ruben emilio varela. instead of boring you with details about myself like my birthplace, my hobbies, or my social security number, let me tell you a story.</p>
        <h2>tonsils</h2>
        <p>back when i was no older than 6 years old, i snored far too loud when i slept and struggled to swallow food. my parents grew worried so they took me to the doctor, as it turned out
            my tonsils were too large for my frail little body. so i was later taken to the hospital and had them removed. after the surgery the doctors recommended i eat ice cream, they
            essentially prescribed me ice cream, so you can imagine i was the happiest little boy after that surgery. considering how much you enjoyed that last stroy let me tell you another one.</p>
        <h2>number sense</h2>
        <p id="numberSenseP">in the 4th grade i was a bit of a math wiz and i was a very competitive one too. i was in an extracurricular class called number sense. essentially we studied and practiced how to solve
            advanced math problems very quickly, and most of the time in our heads. i loved going to the competitions against other school districts because my team and i were kind of badasses and always won.
            i even got third place once against 300 other kids and most of them were two grades above me. but then came one rainy saturday (it wasn't actually raining but for the purposes of dramatization
            let's just agree that it was raining) that day we had our biggest competition of the year, all the number sense classes for every district in almost the entire state were gathered to have a final
            showdown, a showdown so intense, so bloody, so gory, that to this day people still refer to it as ARMAGEDON BETA TESTING (not really but for the purposes of making the story more interesting than
            it is let's just go with it(i have to stop over exagerrating(i also have to stop putting parenthesis inside parenthesis(wow it's parenthi-ception)))) so on that rainy saturday i was excited to help
            my team absolutely demolish all the other kids. but it turns out my mom had other plans for that day so she couldn't take me, and at that moment i knew i would need serious counsiling to recover
            from that traumatic experience. i didn't so they were a man down, and because they were missing they're mvp they didn't rank in the top 3 instead they got forth. my teacher told me that if i
            would've shown up we would've won that competition. that day still haunts me and for as long as i am a breathing living creature on this earth i will never forget the time i missed the number
            sense competition.</p>
